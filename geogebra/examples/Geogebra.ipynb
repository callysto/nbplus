    "# How to use Geogebra with Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "[GeoGebra](geogebra.org) is a powerful tool for creating interactive classroom materials and visualizations that many teachers are familiar with. One limitation of GeoGebra is the distribution of these materials. While GeoGebra allows a teacher to export their material to the GeoGebra website, the online interface makes it difficult to build a lesson around that material.\n",
    "\n",
    "One limitation is that the GeoGebra website will only display one applet at a time. The interface for adding text around the applet also has some limitations. (For example, there doesn't appear to be a straightforward way to add mathematical equations in that text.) The GeoGebra website does allow one to create a \"GeoGebra book\" but this seems to involve a fair amount of work.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is possible to embed a GeoGebra applet in a standard HTML webpage, doing so requires a good working knowledge of HTML, along with familiarity with the GeoGebra embedding API. Both HTML and the GeoGebra website also have the limitation that content cannot be altered by students.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter environment provides us with an alternative: a teacher can build a lesson in a Jupyter notebook containing rich text and mathematical equations, interspersed with interactive GeoGebra applets. This notebook can then be distributed to students, who will be able to not only interact with the GeoGebra, applets: they will also be able to edit and add text. This will allow a teacher to include questions to be answered with the help of the applets, which can be answered by students *within the notebook itself*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only catch is that there has been no straightforward way to integrate Geogebra applets with Jupyter Notebooks -- **until now**!\n",
    "\n",
    "We're working on a Python library to try to make this process as easy and seamless as possible while also providing you with the tools to do some powerful stuff. The library is still in development, but it is already usable!"

    "## Adding GeoGebra materials\n",

    "There are three ways to make your GeoGebra material available for a Jupyter notebook. For each option below, we've written instructions for someone who has created their own GeoGebra material using the GeoGebra 5 Classic desktop app. Note that the second option can be applied to any GeoGebra material you find online, subject to licensing restrictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using a local .ggb file.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For this option, create an applet using the desktop app, and save the file. You will then need to upload the file to your Jupyter server. To load the file foo.ggb, all you need is the command `ggb.file('foo.ggb').draw;`.\n",
    "2. Using an online material hosted on [GeoGebra.org](geogebra.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "    For this option, create your applet, and choose Export --> Dynamic Webpage. (`<ctrl><shift>-W`) Follow the website prompts to create your material. Once it's online, your material will be at an address such as [https://www.geogebra.org/m/MmEp8HXV](https://www.geogebra.org/m/MmEp8HXV). The 8-character string at the end of this address is the identifier for your material, called a **Material ID**. You can then load the applet using the command `ggb.material('MmEp8HXV\").draw();`.\n",
    "3. Using a base64 encoded string.\n",
    "\n",
    "    You can get the base64 string encoding of your applet from the the desktop app by hitting `<ctrl><shift>-B`. This can then be copied and pasted directly into your Jupyter notebook, or saved to a file. See below for details."
