    "This may not have seemed very sophisticated but it's barely scratching the surface of what the API is capable of. It can not only be used to manipulate values, coordinates, labels, colors, layer visibility, animations, and more, but it can also be used to read values from the applets.\n",

    "# Todo:\n",
    "1. Finish implementing the **API** so that Geogebra applets can be used with Ipython widgets.\n",
    "    1. Investigate the best way to send information from Javascript back out to Python variables (can apparently be done by using Javascript to execute Python code on the kernel but that seems ridiculous).\n",
    "2. Implement *event handling* so that Geogebra applets can interact with each other.\n",
    "    1. Still at the planning stages. Scope and difficulty uncertain.\n",
    "3. Implement *global defaults* (so that you don't have to set stuff like `width` and `borderColor` in each cell)\n",
    "4. Try to figure out a way to **automatically scale** the width and height.\n",
    "5. Make this guide **bigger** and **better**!\n",
    "6. Create a separate **reference section** detailing the ins and outs of the API.\n",
    "7. Create a **quickstart** on Geogebra for teachers or developers who are unfamiliar with it.\n",
    "8. Possibly communicate with the Geogebra crew about making some patches to their `deployggb.js` library (or instead write our own version based off of theirs as, but only if absolutely necessary).\n",
    "9. Possibly implement a custom `%ggb` **magic** (and investigate if magics give us a nice way to integrate with widgets).\n",
    "10. Possibly patch https://github.com/azjps/ipython-geogebra to work with the new geogebra API as it's currently broken.\n",
    "11. Investigate making the libraries local so that the notebooks can be used **while offline** (some documentation seems to exist).\n",
    "12. Investigate possible memory leaking on notebooks that stay running for a long time and have a lot of applets frequently being created/destroyed. Refactor code to garbage collect stuff internally to address this, if necessary.\n",
    "13. Investigate drawing the same applet in different cells.\n",
    "14. Investigate possible issues with base64 code and naming."
